"""
Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive),
find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the
missing element.
Examples:

Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
