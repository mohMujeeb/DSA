# Class is a blueprint for creating objects 

# Lets create student class and print student data
class Student:   # Blue Print
    name = "Shushant"       # Data 
    
# Lets create instance/object of student class to access student data
obj = Student()     # Instance/Object
print(obj.name)     


# Lets create a Car class with some data i.e: color, brand, model 

class Car:
    color = "Red"
    brand = "Toyota"
    model = "Corolla"
    
# Lets create an instance/object of Car class to access car data
car = Car()
print("Car Name: ",car.color)
print("Car Brand: ",car.brand)
print("Car Name: ",car.model)
