# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) In Python 

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to programming concepts and basic mathematical problems, particularly focusing on the essentials of DSA.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. [Things to Know in Programming](https://github.com/mohMujeeb/DSA/blob/main/Things%20to%20know%20in%20programming.ipynb)
This notebook covers fundamental programming concepts and is an excellent starting point for beginners. Topics include:
- **Input Output**: The classic first step in learning a new programming language.
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding how to store and manipulate data.
- **Control Structures**: Using conditionals and loops to control the flow of programs.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions to structure your code efficiently.

### 2. [Know the Basic Math](https://github.com/mohMujeeb/DSA/blob/main/Know%20Basic%20Math.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on solving basic mathematical problems that are crucial for programming and algorithmic thinking. Problems covered include:
- **Count Digits**: Determine the number of digits in a number.
- **Reverse a Number**: Reverse the digits of a given number.
- **Check Palindrome**: Verify if a number is a palindrome.
- **GCD or HCF**: Compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers.
- **Armstrong Numbers**: Identify if a number is an Armstrong number.
- **Print All Divisors**: Find and display all divisors of a number.
- **Check for Prime**: Check if a number is prime.

### 3. [Build Up Logical Thinking](https://github.com/mohMujeeb/DSA/blob/main/Build%20up%20logical%20thinking.ipynb)
This notebook covers all patterns which help in builiding logical thinking.
Practicing Python Pattern Programs offers several benefits, such as 
- improving **problem-solving skills**,
- enhancing **logical thinking**,
- reinforcing **control flow concepts**, and
- developing a better understanding of **programming fundamentals**.
